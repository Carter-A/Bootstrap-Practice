                  <h4>HTML5</h4>
                  <p>The HTML code I write is semantic, SEO friendly, and most importatly, beautiful. I primarily use Bootstrap as a framework to produce responsive, mobile first sites. It is now more important than ever to ensure content can be accessed on a huge range of devices.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4 css-info">
                  <h4>CSS</h4>
                  <p>What an ugly web we would have without css. My css is well organized and properly annotated. On larger projects multiple css files, paired with a indexing system ensures whom ever is working on it wastes no time, and is never lost. I am currently using Sass as my preprocesser.</p>

                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>The language that brings life to the web. I favor jQuery for speed of development and seemingly endless applicability. I have the ability to code in basic JavaScript, however, find it more efficient to use jQuery. I am currently learning AngularJs to further challenge my skill set and build full web applications. </p>

                    <h4>PHP</h4>
                    <p>By no means an expert, however, I am learning at a quick rate through wordpress's structure. Tearing down and building up themes for client's custom needs. The added challange of a 'real' programming language is fantastic. PHP allows me to scratch my learning itch.</p>

                    <p>My text editor of choice currently is Sublime Text 3. It is obviously the industry standard and for good reason. When combined with Emmet it makes my life much easier.</p>

                    <p>I use Git as my version control system. Operating from the command line, projects I am working on are held centrally at GitHub and can be accesssed by anyone. A powerful tool and community no web dev should be without.</p>
